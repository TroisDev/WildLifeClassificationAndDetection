# WildLifeClassificationAndDetection
This project is about protecting wildife by detecting poachers


# Project Aim
> This project aims to improve species identification accuracy and real-time monitoring capabilities for wildlife conservation. It focuses on developing a robust system to detect wildlife threatened by poaching activities. The system uses classification and object detection methodologies, with zero-shot detection applied if a predator is detected. The system triggers an automatic notification to park rangers, enabling swift response measures. This integration of real-time monitoring and automated notification systems enhances anti-poaching efforts and contributes to endangered wildlife conservation.

# Technologies
The base model for object detection is DETR, which consists of a convolutional backbone and an encoder-decoder Transformer. The classification framework is fine-tuned using the EfficientNetB0 model and zero-shot detection applied if a predator is detected.
