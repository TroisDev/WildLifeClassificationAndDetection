# WildLifeClassificationAndDetection
This project is about protecting wildife by detecting poachers


# Project Aim
> The research aims to improve species identification accuracy and real-time monitoring capabilities for wildlife conservation in Namibia. It focuses on developing a robust system to detect wildlife threatened by poaching activities. The system uses classification and object detection methodologies, with zero-shot detection applied if a predator is detected. The system triggers an automatic notification to park rangers, enabling swift response measures. This integration of real-time monitoring and automated notification systems enhances anti-poaching efforts and contributes to Namibia's endangered wildlife conservation.
